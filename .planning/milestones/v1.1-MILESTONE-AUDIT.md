# Milestone v1.1 Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.1 Execution Isolation & Failure Learnings
**Audited:** 2026-01-21
**Status:** PASSED

## Executive Summary

All v1.1 requirements satisfied. Cross-phase integration verified. All end-to-end flows complete. No gaps found.

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Phase | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| EXEC-01: Autopilot auto-launches new terminal | 11 | SATISFIED | autopilot.md Step 4 calls terminal-launcher.js |
| EXEC-02: Terminal launcher detects platform | 11 | SATISFIED | process.platform + TERMINAL_CONFIG (win32/darwin/linux) |
| EXEC-03: Fallback to manual instructions | 11 | SATISFIED | showManualInstructions() on detection failure |
| EXEC-04: Ralph.sh runs as independent process | 11 | SATISFIED | detached: true + subprocess.unref() |
| FAIL-01: Extract failure reason from Claude output | 12 | SATISFIED | extract_failure_reason() in learnings.sh |
| FAIL-02: Structure failure context into learnings | 12 | SATISFIED | append_failure_learning() creates 5-field entries |
| FAIL-03: Append failure learnings to AGENTS.md | 12 | SATISFIED | Failure Context section in AGENTS.md |
| FAIL-04: Retry includes failure learnings | 12 | SATISFIED | get_learnings_for_phase() returns failure context |

**Score:** 8/8 requirements satisfied

## Phase Verification

| Phase | Status | Score | Verified |
|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| 11: Terminal Launcher | PASSED | 11/11 | 2026-01-21T02:38:45Z |
| 12: Failure Learnings | PASSED | 5/5 | 2026-01-21T03:37:01Z |

**Score:** 2/2 phases verified

## Cross-Phase Integration

| Export | Defined In | Used By | Status |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|
| launchTerminal | terminal-launcher.js:213 | autopilot.md Step 4 | CONNECTED |
| findTerminal | terminal-launcher.js:39 | Internal (launchTerminal) | CONNECTED |
| showManualInstructions | terminal-launcher.js:169 | launchTerminal on failure | CONNECTED |
| extract_failure_reason | learnings.sh:426 | ralph.sh:167 | CONNECTED |
| append_failure_learning | learnings.sh:518 | ralph.sh:188 | CONNECTED |
| clear_phase_failures | learnings.sh:687 | ralph.sh:97,104 | CONNECTED |
| get_learnings_for_phase | learnings.sh:92 | invoke.sh:60 | CONNECTED |
| terminal-launcher → ralph.sh | terminal-launcher spawns | ralph.sh sources learnings.sh | CONNECTED |

**Score:** 8/8 exports properly wired

## End-to-End Flows

### Flow 1: Autopilot Launch
User runs autopilot → platform detected → terminal found → terminal spawned → process detached → ralph.sh starts → autopilot returns → (fallback on failure)

**Status:** COMPLETE

### Flow 2: Failure Capture and Retry
Task fails → failure state updated → failure extracted → failure stored → AGENTS.md updated → user retries → Claude invoked → learnings loaded → failure context included → prompt built

**Status:** COMPLETE

### Flow 3: Phase Boundary Cleanup
Task succeeds → success handler → next plan determined → phase boundary detected → failures cleared → AGENTS.md cleaned

**Status:** COMPLETE

**Score:** 3/3 flows verified

## Tech Debt

No tech debt accumulated in v1.1 phases.

## Gaps

No gaps found.

## Artifacts

### Phase 11: Terminal Launcher
- bin/lib/terminal-launcher.js (270 lines)
- commands/gsd/autopilot.md (updated Step 4)
- package.json (command-exists dependency)

### Phase 12: Failure Learnings
- bin/lib/learnings.sh (802 lines, 5 new functions)
- bin/ralph.sh (530 lines, integration complete)
- .planning/AGENTS.md (Failure Context section)

## Conclusion

Milestone v1.1 achieved its definition of done:

1. **Execution Isolation:** Autopilot auto-launches ralph.sh in a separate terminal window. Process runs independently. User can close Claude session.

2. **Failure Learnings:** Failed tasks have their failure reason extracted, structured, and stored in AGENTS.md. Retry attempts include failure context to avoid repeating mistakes.

All requirements covered. All phases verified. All integrations wired. All flows complete.

**Ready for milestone completion.**
