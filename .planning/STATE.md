## Current Position

Phase: 12 - Failure Learnings
Plan: 12-01 of 2 (in progress)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-21 - Completed 12-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [█████████████████████████████░] 100% (v1.1: 24/24 plans total)

## Milestone History

| Version | Name | Phases | Shipped |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| v1.0 | Lazy Mode MVP | 1-10 (22 plans) | 2026-01-20 |
| v1.1 | Execution Isolation & Failure Learnings | 11-12 (TBD plans) | In Progress |

## v1.1 Phase Summary

| Phase | Goal | Requirements | Status |
|-------|------|--------------|--------|
| 11 | Terminal Launcher | EXEC-01, EXEC-02, EXEC-03, EXEC-04 | Complete |
| 12 | Failure Learnings | FAIL-01, FAIL-02, FAIL-03, FAIL-04 | In Progress (1/2) |

## Decisions

| Decision | Phase-Plan | Context | Impact |
|----------|------------|---------|--------|
| Use command-exists for terminal detection | 11-01 | Cross-platform terminal launcher | Reliable terminal emulator detection across platforms |
| Prioritize Windows Terminal > cmd > PowerShell > Git Bash | 11-01 | Windows terminal selection | Quality over alphabetical ordering |
| Implement manual fallback instructions | 11-01 | EXEC-03 requirement | Graceful degradation when detection fails |
| Replace inline ralph.sh execution with terminal-launcher | 11-02 | Autopilot integration | Execution isolation - user can close Claude session after launch |
| Autopilot returns immediately after launch | 11-02 | Process isolation pattern | No longer waits for ralph.sh completion |
| Remove ralph.sh exit code handling from autopilot | 11-02 | Independent execution | Ralph.sh handles its own completion states in separate terminal |
| Use jq for JSON parsing with grep/sed fallback | 12-01 | Failure extraction | Works on systems without jq installed |
| Multi-line failure entry format | 12-01 | Failure storage | Full context for retries (task ID, timestamp, error, attempted, files, context) |
| Phase-scoped subsections in Failure Context | 12-01 | Failure organization | Enables selective cleanup on phase completion |
| 100-failure cap per phase | 12-01 | Resource management | Prevents unbounded growth, drops oldest first |
