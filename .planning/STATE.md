# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-19)

**Core value:** Plan once, walk away, wake up to done. No human needed at the computer after planning.
**Current focus:** Phase 8 - Upfront Planning

## Current Position

Phase: 8 of 10 (Upfront Planning)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-01-20 - Completed 08-02-PLAN.md

Progress: [######################        ] 70%

## Next Action

Command: /gsd:execute-phase 9
Description: Start Phase 9 (Mode Selection)
Read: ROADMAP.md, 09-CONTEXT.md or 09-01-PLAN.md

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 17
- Average duration: ~4.1 min
- Total execution time: ~69 minutes

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Safety Foundation | 2/2 | ~8 min | ~4 min |
| 2 - State Extensions | 2/2 | ~7 min | ~3.5 min |
| 3 - Outer Loop Core | 3/3 | ~10 min | ~3.3 min |
| 4 - Git Checkpointing | 2/2 | ~7 min | ~3.5 min |
| 5 - Exit Conditions | 2/2 | ~10 min | ~5 min |
| 6 - Circuit Breaker | 2/2 | ~8 min | ~4 min |
| 7 - Learnings Propagation | 2/2 | ~8 min | ~4 min |
| 8 - Upfront Planning | 2/2 | ~11 min | ~5.5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 06-02 (4m), 07-01 (4m), 07-02 (4m), 08-01 (8m), 08-02 (3m)
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- MAX_RETRIES=3 hardcoded (per user decision)
- Functions return exit codes for caller handling (not exit directly)
- Color codes: RED=failure, GREEN=success, YELLOW=warning/retry
- Config stored in .planning/.ralph-config (project-local)
- Defaults: 50 iterations, 8 hours timeout
- Interactive mode detected via [[ -t 0 ]] check
- HTML comment markers for STATE.md sections (HISTORY_START/END)
- ASCII # for progress bar (cross-platform compatible)
- PROGRESS_WIDTH=30 for visual balance
- HISTORY_WINDOW=15 entries before archive rotation
- ASCII-only spinner characters (|/-\\) for Git Bash compatibility
- NO_COLOR standard via environment variable check
- LF line endings enforced for all *.sh files via .gitattributes
- parse_next_task extracts plan ID from STATE.md using grep -oE '[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}'
- get_next_plan_after finds next uncompleted plan from ROADMAP.md checkboxes
- Iteration success advances next_action; failure stays on same task for retry
- Claude CLI invoked with -p flag, --output-format json, --allowedTools
- JSON parsing uses jq when available, grep/sed fallback otherwise
- Exit code > 1 = Claude crash (abort), exit code 1 = normal failure (Retry/Skip/Abort)
- 30-minute duration alert logged (no hard timeout)
- Commit failure is FATAL - cannot continue without checkpoint safety net
- Detached HEAD shows warning but allows execution (commits still work)
- Checkpoint sequence: handle_iteration_success -> create_checkpoint_commit -> mark_checkpoint
- STATE.md position compared against git checkpoint history at startup
- Conflict detection: STATE.md behind git = conflict, STATE.md ahead = OK
- Interactive mode prompts for state vs git resolution; non-interactive fails safe
- STUCK_THRESHOLD=3 consecutive failures on same task triggers stuck exit
- Exit codes: 0=COMPLETED, 1=STUCK, 2=ABORTED, 3=INTERRUPTED
- Critical sections protect checkpoint commits from interrupt
- exit_with_status returns code, caller calls exit (functions never exit directly)
- TESTS_UNKNOWN treated as passing (accept false negatives over false positives)
- Dual-exit gate: both tests pass AND all plans complete required for COMPLETED status
- Test parsing uses generic patterns (PASS/FAIL/OK/ERROR) for framework independence
- last_output_file preserved between iterations for completion check
- CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD=5 (higher than STUCK_THRESHOLD=3 to avoid overlap)
- Circuit breaker increments unconditionally (no task-change reset unlike stuck detection)
- Skip option resets circuit breaker (user intervention = system state change)
- Non-interactive mode returns abort signal from circuit breaker (fail fast)
- ANALYSIS_WINDOW=5 matches CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD for consistent failure window
- Stuck analysis examines: error keywords, file references, task prefixes
- Alternative actions are pattern-aware (file suggests git diff, error suggests grep)
- MAX_AGENTS_LINES=100 warning, MAX_AGENTS_LINES_HARD=150 hard cap for AGENTS.md
- Exact-match deduplication for learnings using grep -qF
- Phase N learnings go under ## Phase-Specific as ### subsections
- patterns-established -> Phase section, key-decisions -> Codebase Patterns
- Safe optional dependency using type check (type func &>/dev/null)
- Learnings injected under '## Project Learnings' header in Claude prompt
- Learning extraction happens before checkpoint commit (included in commit)
- Planning progress uses HTML comment markers (PLANNING_PROGRESS_START/END)
- Phase enumeration handles both integer and decimal phase numbers
- Session IDs use planning-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM format
- plan-milestone-all is orchestrator over gsd-planner, not replacement
- Sequential phase planning to respect inter-phase dependencies
- Dependency warnings before plan refinement
- User exits refinement loop by typing proceed/done/ready
- Refinement uses revision mode for targeted plan updates (not full replan)
