# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-19)

**Core value:** Plan once, walk away, wake up to done. No human needed at the computer after planning.
**Current focus:** Phase 6 - Circuit Breaker & Recovery

## Current Position

Phase: 6 of 10 (Circuit Breaker & Recovery)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-19 - Completed 06-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [#############                 ] 46%

## Next Action

Command: /gsd:execute-phase 6
Description: Execute plan 06-02 (Stuck analysis and alternative approaches)
Read: ROADMAP.md, 06-02-PLAN.md

## Iteration History

<!-- HISTORY_START -->
| # | Timestamp | Outcome | Task |
|---|-----------|---------|------|
<!-- HISTORY_END -->

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 12
- Average duration: ~3.8 min
- Total execution time: ~46 minutes

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Safety Foundation | 2/2 | ~8 min | ~4 min |
| 2 - State Extensions | 2/2 | ~7 min | ~3.5 min |
| 3 - Outer Loop Core | 3/3 | ~10 min | ~3.3 min |
| 4 - Git Checkpointing | 2/2 | ~7 min | ~3.5 min |
| 5 - Exit Conditions | 2/2 | ~10 min | ~5 min |
| 6 - Circuit Breaker | 1/2 | ~4 min | ~4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 04-01 (4m), 04-02 (3m), 05-01 (4m), 05-02 (6m), 06-01 (4m)
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- MAX_RETRIES=3 hardcoded (per user decision)
- Functions return exit codes for caller handling (not exit directly)
- Color codes: RED=failure, GREEN=success, YELLOW=warning/retry
- Config stored in .planning/.ralph-config (project-local)
- Defaults: 50 iterations, 8 hours timeout
- Interactive mode detected via [[ -t 0 ]] check
- HTML comment markers for STATE.md sections (HISTORY_START/END)
- ASCII # for progress bar (cross-platform compatible)
- PROGRESS_WIDTH=30 for visual balance
- HISTORY_WINDOW=15 entries before archive rotation
- ASCII-only spinner characters (|/-\\) for Git Bash compatibility
- NO_COLOR standard via environment variable check
- LF line endings enforced for all *.sh files via .gitattributes
- parse_next_task extracts plan ID from STATE.md using grep -oE '[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}'
- get_next_plan_after finds next uncompleted plan from ROADMAP.md checkboxes
- Iteration success advances next_action; failure stays on same task for retry
- Claude CLI invoked with -p flag, --output-format json, --allowedTools
- JSON parsing uses jq when available, grep/sed fallback otherwise
- Exit code > 1 = Claude crash (abort), exit code 1 = normal failure (Retry/Skip/Abort)
- 30-minute duration alert logged (no hard timeout)
- Commit failure is FATAL - cannot continue without checkpoint safety net
- Detached HEAD shows warning but allows execution (commits still work)
- Checkpoint sequence: handle_iteration_success -> create_checkpoint_commit -> mark_checkpoint
- STATE.md position compared against git checkpoint history at startup
- Conflict detection: STATE.md behind git = conflict, STATE.md ahead = OK
- Interactive mode prompts for state vs git resolution; non-interactive fails safe
- STUCK_THRESHOLD=3 consecutive failures on same task triggers stuck exit
- Exit codes: 0=COMPLETED, 1=STUCK, 2=ABORTED, 3=INTERRUPTED
- Critical sections protect checkpoint commits from interrupt
- exit_with_status returns code, caller calls exit (functions never exit directly)
- TESTS_UNKNOWN treated as passing (accept false negatives over false positives)
- Dual-exit gate: both tests pass AND all plans complete required for COMPLETED status
- Test parsing uses generic patterns (PASS/FAIL/OK/ERROR) for framework independence
- last_output_file preserved between iterations for completion check
- CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD=5 (higher than STUCK_THRESHOLD=3 to avoid overlap)
- Circuit breaker increments unconditionally (no task-change reset unlike stuck detection)
- Skip option resets circuit breaker (user intervention = system state change)
- Non-interactive mode returns abort signal from circuit breaker (fail fast)
